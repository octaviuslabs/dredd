Q - replacing ricky  williams:??
Q - contrary to published reports,  ricky williams=   bypassed surgery today to seek another opinion according to  espn.?
Q - the wor= d  is that jim haslett  will likely not go outside the team for a back.?
Q - chad=   morton and jerald moore will likely  be the choices with morton getting fir= st  shot.?
Q - morton ,s a little undersized at 5 , 8 8  and 186 but so is sa= n  francisco's charlie garner and he manages pretty  well.?
Q - ?morton came from a=   big  time program at usc and averaged 20+ carries a game last year so it = ,s  not like  he isn ,t used to carrying the load.?
Q - according to espn, brett favre ,s foot = is  much  better and he may practice this week.?
Q - akili smith benched.?
Q - not  just benched.?
Q - benched for scott  mitchell.?
Q - with trung canidate out for the  year with a=   broken wrist, marshall faulk has reportedly told the coaches he may  be abl= e  to play this week.?
Q - most  think that ,s too optimistic but it ,s nice t= o see  the desire there.?
Q - jeff george to  start?
Q - ?according to the redskins, jeff george will start =   again this week at qb.?
Q - coach norv turner has stated the starting qb job is=    brad?johnson's when he's?healthy, possibly in?week 13.  ?
Q - a= s  we head into our 12th week of listing these players, it ,s  inevitable th= at  some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade  list.?
Q - make sure=   you understand,  what we ,re talking about is players that are moving.?
Q - i= n  other words, a player like te chad  lewis could appear on the downgrade lis= t  and still be good enough to be a  starter in your league.?
Q - it just  means i=  ,m  concerned about the way he seems to be heading.?
Q - likewise, a player like wr=   laveranues  coles may make the upgrade list even though he ,s still fairl= y far  down the list  of wrs.?
Q - joe  ?
Q - upgrades and  downgrades.?
Q - qbs moving up  qb mark  brunell (jac)??
Q - behind a beat=  up  line, he ,s standing in  there (while taking a beating) and delivering th= e  ball.?
Q - jimmy smith made a roaring comeback and  paired with keenan mccardel= l,  they ,re one of the better wr tandems in the  league.?
Q - qb kerry  collins (nyg)?
Q - he  looks more comfortable in  the pocket, especially in his footwork and drop=   backs.?
Q - watch to see how amani toomer is doing  but when he ,s healthy, t= oomer  and ike hilliard make a great wr corps.?
Q - a?solid ground game in ron dayne a= nd  tiki  barber continue to help the passing game.
Q - qb?
Q - donovan mcnabb (phi)?
Q - with  deuce staley gone, mcnabb ,s had to shoul= der  the offense and this week he came  through with flying colors.?
Q - the bad  ne= ws  is he only completed 47% of his passes sunday.?
Q - when a qb airs it out 55  times in one game, it doesn ,t=   usually bode well for the team ,s chances of  winning but it ,s certain= ly a  plus for your ff team to see that many  attempts.?
Q - with that many chances, =   it ,s like allowing yourself to double the stats a jeff blake (23 attempt= s  this  week) or jeff garcia (25 attempts) puts up.?
Q - qb trent  dilfer (bal)??
Q - remember, this list is  relative.?
Q - while he may no= t  be a  starter, dilfer is definitely moving up the charts and that ,s what=  this  list is  all about.?
Q - he actually looked very  good at times in the huge  victory over tennessee sunday.?
Q - he showed nice poise coming back after   basically throwing the game away a few plays earlier.?
Q - brian billick did  wonders with a  marginally talented tony banks in 1999 and it ,s conceiva= ble  he might do it here  again with dilfer.?
Q - they play dallas  and cleveland ne= xt  but keep in mind baltimore has a bye on december  3.  qb troy  aikman (dal)?
Q - notice a  pattern here??
Q - after being named the  starter sunda= y,  aikman went out and lit up the bengal defense which was ranked #  20 over t= he  last 4 weeks.?
Q - tough matchup this week  = vs  baltimore but he gets the vikings in week 13.  qb jeff  blake?
Q - (no)?
Q - you of course know by now that rb ricky williams is =   gone for 6-8 weeks.?
Q - i hate it for  williams owners (i ,m one) but what=  ,s done  is done.?
Q - all we can do now is look forward.?
Q - and looking forward, i see  blake being  forced to carry an increased load.?
Q - qb rob  johnson (buf)?
Q - i make it a point to hold my tongue on  coaching  issues but i ,ve gotta say i think mr. charisma with the spiffy  sweaters= ,  wade phillips, is 100% wrong in going to johnson.?
Q - in terms of roster  management, he ,s  hands down the worst in the nfl in my opinion.?
Q - but no= ne of  that really matters as rob  johnson has to make the upgrade list since he=  ,s  been named the starter for this  week.?
Q - ?=   johnson finishes roughly  half the games he starts and the next three weeks=   vs kansas city, tampa bay and  miami could be brutal.?
Q - qb matt  hasselbeck (gb)?
Q - hasselbeck played nicely replacing favre  this  week.?
Q - remember there was even  some talk about trading favre and starting=   hasselbeck this summer when favre ,s  elbow was a big concern.?
Q - before yo= u   give up the farm to snare hasselbeck, you should know brett favre is  reportedly  feeling better and hoping to play this week.?
Q - qb shane  matthews / cade mcnown (chi)?
Q - again, i ,m highlighting guys mov= ing   up.?
Q - with the injury to jim miller,  shane matthews will be thrust into the=   starting role.?
Q - the injury will also likely add a little  fire under cade=   mcnown who may be rushed back a little sooner than he would have  been if=   miller was performing well.?
Q - matthews looked very rusty but it ,s tough = to  judge a qb when he ,s thrust  into the game like that.?
Q - rbs moving up  rb lamar  smith (mia)?
Q - you have to keep giving this guy his  props after  another great game.?
Q - although, if you ,ve got an owner salivating over s= mith  and you can get a  lot in return, it might be a great time to trade him.?
Q - i=   can ,t imagine his value being any  higher.?
Q - his yard per carry number  d= ipped  to 2.6 in sunday ,s game and he faces the jets this week plus a brutal =   matchup against tampa bay in week 15.?
Q - rb edgerrin  james (ind)?
Q - he  averaged 4.2?
Q - yards per carry sunday  and=   the colts are leaning heavily on him.?
Q - rb robert  smith (min)?
Q - smith quietly is having an incredible  year.?
Q - keep an eye on that tasty=   week 13  matchup against the cowboys.?
Q - rb fred  taylor (jac)?
Q - jaguar fans may be distraught, but fred  taylor owne= rs  have to be happy, at least lately.?
Q - taylor ,s running as well as he has i= n   his career, even if his team is struggling.?
Q - one can only wonder what he = ,d be  doing  with a healthy supporting cast.?
Q - rb jamal  anderson (atl)?
Q - he ran hard a= nd  with the power and  quickness that pushed him to stardom.??
Q - rb michael  pittman (ari)?
Q - pittman ,s nursing a chest / rib injury  so ke= ep an  eye on that but assuming he ,s ok, he has to make the upgrade  list.?
Q - he=   scored a td sunday and  averaged 4.2 yards per carry on 12 carries.?
Q - he als= o  added 8 receptions.?
Q - his main competition for carries, thomas  jones, had a=   yard per carry average that equaled his fumbles sunday:?
Q - 1.00???
Q - rb justin  watson (stl)?
Q - watson held his own sunday as he rushed  for 62  yards on 17 carries.??
Q - he likely won ,t be a factor long as marshall fau= lk is  already itching to  get back on the field but he might be worth a shot for=   one more  week.?
Q - rb ahman  green (gb)?
Q - with dorsey levens , troubles, green  clearly shoot= s up  the charts.?
Q - rb chad  morton (no)?
Q - last year at usc, he carried a full load  as the featured rusher s= o  he ,s capable.?
Q - ?=  new  orleans has a fairly favorable  rushing schedule ahead with oakland, denver= ,  san francisco and atlanta all  ahead.
Q - ??
Q - wrs moving up  wr james  mcknight (dal)?
Q - wow.?
Q - what else can you say but give the man   credit.?
Q - 8 catches for 164 yards  with a td is a pretty good day.?
Q - whether=   he and troy aikman can keep it rolling is the question but you  have to lik= e  what he ,s done thus far.?
Q - wr sean  dawkins?
Q - (sea)?
Q - excuse  us for not getting excited about a guy who=   was buried on the seahawks a few  weeks ago and had jon kitna throwing to=   him.?
Q - but kitna ,s looking better and dawkins  responded with a great gam= e.?
Q - like  mcknight, the question is whether he can keep it up but he ,s worth=  a  roll of the  dice.?
Q - wr torry  holt (stl)?
Q - i drew a few snickers a month ago when i  said i  thought derrick mason was the best wr on the titans.?
Q - louis.?
Q - holt ,s really coming into his own and to be honest, benefits gr= eatly  from  the attention isaac bruce draws.?
Q - he  does face a couple of strong  defenses in washington and new orleans but i ,m  betting he manages to pr= oduce  against tough competition.?
Q - wr derrick  mason (ten)?
Q - partly = by  default as kevin dyson ,s gone and carl pickens is injured.?
Q - but partly=   because he ,s just that  good.?
Q - the titans had their running  game shut d= own  by baltimore sunday and they were forced to the air.?
Q - and much to the  surprise of many, qb  steve mcnair fared pretty well and mason was a big pa= rt  of that  success.?
Q - wr ricky  proehl (stl)?
Q - great, just what fantasy gms need  )  another ram=  wr  to worry about.?
Q - proehl caught 6 passes for 53 yards and a td sunday.?
Q - in = an  offense missing rb marshall faulk  as high powered as the rams, there ,s=   probably room for another wr at the  trough.???
Q - wr patrick  johnson (bal)?
Q - johnson replaced travis taylor in the  lineup an= d  came up big with the game winning td.?
Q - he only caught 3 passes but  understand  that he ,s the 3rd receiver behind te shannon sharpe and wr q= adry   ismail.?
Q - still though, it ,s a brian  billick team and trent dilfer is pl= aying  better with each series it  seems.?
Q - wr jimmy  smith?
Q - (jac)???
Q - with 10 catches for 117 yards, i guess you can s= ay  he ,s back.?
Q - the jags may be struggling but smith and  qb mark brunell ar= e  back in synch.?
Q - ride it while the combo is hot.?
Q - wr jerome  pathon (ind)?
Q - terrence wilkins had a firm grasp on the  #2 wr sp= ot  early in the season but pathon seems to be taking over there.?
Q - pathon is  playing with more confidence  and more importantly, seems to have the  confidence of qb peyton manning.?
Q - he had 3 catches for 42 yards  sunday.?
Q - tes moving up?
Q - te bubba  franks (gb)?
Q - for a long while franks and te tyrone  davis had  battled for time.?
Q - te rod  rutledge (ne)?
Q - so much for eric bjornson.?
Q - rutledge seems to be the=   new te threat  for the patriots and you know drew bledsoe likes to throw to=   the te.?
Q - if he can just get that thumb  healthy (?
Q - te shannon  sharpe (bal)??
Q - after some quiet weeks, sharpe has  returned to=   his place of one of the premier tes in the game.?
Q - ???
Q - qbs moving  down?
Q - qb trent  green (stl)?
Q - mike martz said a couple of weeks ago he  felt that=   having green behind center was  &just like having kurt in there 8.?
Q - we = believe  him.?
Q - even as well as = he ,s  been  playing, the league mvp warner does not lose his job to a broken hand= .?
Q - the team is talking about december 3 as  a possible date he ,ll be back b= ut i , ve heard even sooner.?
Q - regardless, you have to figure his days  are  numbered.?
Q - plus, upcoming games  against washington and new orleans in the=   next two weeks could pose a  threat.?
Q - qb doug  flutie?
Q - (buf)?
Q - right  or wrong, flutie takes a seat as rob johnson=  ,s  been named the starter this  week.?
Q - qb drew  bledsoe (ne)?
Q - so much for the boston globe ,s bill  belichick  conspiracy that bledsoe would miss several weeks.?
Q - still though, you could=   clearly see he  wasn ,t 100% with the thumb.???
Q - qb brett  favre (gb)?
Q - as you know, favre suffered a sprained  foot against=   tampa.?
Q - while everyone  was shouting about how many weeks he ,d miss, fav= re  told anyone who ,d listen  today that he looked to be ready for this week=  ,s  game against indianapolis.?
Q - players are notoriously optimistic so  keep an=   eye on it.?
Q - qb elvis  grbac (kc)?
Q - he = just  showed sunday he ,s  human.?
Q - he really should have done  more against san=   francisco though.?
Q - on a side note, didn ,t he say he ,d shave that goo= fy beard  when they  lost?
Q - (?
Q - qb brian  griese (den)?
Q - keep an eye  on this.?
Q - qb charlie  batch (det)another game, another  less than impressive  performance.?
Q - batch just seems to struggle to get anything done.???
Q - qb akili  smith (cin)?
Q - qb jim  miller (chi)?
Q - talk about blowing an opportunity.?
Q - miller had been=   moving the bears and  looked to be the spark chicago was missing with cade=   mcnown.?
Q - = nasty  injury  and too bad as he was showing promise.???
Q - rbs moving down?
Q - rb charlie  garner (sf)?
Q - garner ,s been a regular on the upgrade  list an= d he  had another huge game sunday where he posted 141 total yards with a  td  against the chiefs.?
Q - two big days  loom on the horizon though.?
Q - i  promise=   you he ,ll be shut out in week 13 (he has a bye.?
Q - rb ricky  williams (no)?
Q - i had to=   chuckle watching  saints head coach jim haslett talk about how ricky doesn=  ,t  play defense and  didn ,t make any of those sacks or force any fumbles an= d  about how ricky ,s just  one guy and they ,ll be fine.?
Q - ?that  sounds good jim but you ,re in for a rude awakening if  you really believ= e  that (i don ,t think he does)?
Q - chad morton will be the likely  replacemen= t.?
Q - jerald moore will get  a shot too.???
Q - rb tshimanga  biakabutuka (car)?
Q - 1.7 yards per carry will not get it done f= or  a  featured rb in this league and that ,s exactly what biakabutuka posted=    sunday.?
Q - rb mike  alstott (tb)?
Q - it seems as if alstott is less of a factor every   game.?
Q - he only had 9 rushing  attempts sunday for 38 yards.?
Q - if i  were him= ,  i ,d pay keyshawn to tell the coaches i needed some  carries (?
Q - rb emmitt  smith (dal)?
Q - ?=   smith fumbled early on what should have  been a sure td and never seemed to=   recover.?
Q - i thought he ,d carry the load for a  struggling aikman.?
Q - turne= d out  the  other way around.?
Q - rb shaun  alexander (sea)?
Q - so much for the idea of coach mike  holmgren  throwing in the towel for 2000 and starting the young players like   alexander.?
Q - the rookie is a fine  player and will get his time but for now,=   it doesn ,t , seem to be happening  anytime soon.?
Q - rb trung  canidate?
Q - (stl)?
Q - canidate broke his wrist sunday and will miss t= he  rest of the  season.?
Q - i have no idea how the rams  will function without  him.?
Q - wrs moving down?
Q - wr marvin  harrison (ind)?
Q - is it just me or is marvin harrison  getting mor= e  and more quiet with each game??
Q - he only had 4 catches for 34 yards  sunday=   and didn ,t seem to be a big factor.?
Q - wr terry  glenn (ne)?
Q - glenn ,s faded down the stretch and the  bledsoe th= umb  injury won ,t help his play one bit.?
Q - wr marcus  robinson (chi)?
Q - the loss of qb jim miller is huge.?
Q - robinson will make=   any qb better but there ,s only so much he can  do.?
Q - wr antonio  freeman (gb)?
Q - freeman appears to be headed toward the  path he=   was on a few weeks ago  ) mediocrity.?
Q - with a?less than  healthy?favre, it could be worse.???
Q - wr jacquez  green (tb)?
Q - keyshawn johnson ,s gain is green ,s loss  as q= b shaun  king seems locked in on johnson.?
Q - green will still catch the occasional  lo= ng  ball but it appears for now, he ,s the clear cut #2 wr.?
Q - wr terrence  wilkins (ind)?
Q - suddenly, terrence wilkins is the  forgotten ma= n  in the colts passing game.?
Q - for some reason, peyton manning just isn ,t=   giving him the looks.???
Q - tes moving down?
Q - te kyle  brady (jac)?
Q - brady ,s still a solid te but with the  return of j= immy  smith, it ,s clear that he won ,t be the big target he had  been.???
Q - te jay  reimersma (buf)?
Q - reimersma was a total non factor in  sunday ,s g= ame  catching only 1 pass for 7 yards.?
Q - one has to think the qb shuffle could =   have an effect.?
Q - te itula  mili (sea)?
Q - mili ,s yielded his starting te job to  christian f= auria  and fauria seems fairly intent on keeping it.?

Q - hi folks, ?
Q - before we jump to this week's updated players in  the news, i wanted to let  you know we've updated the target  numbers.?
Q - understanding how many times a  player has been thrown to  (targeted) can offer a much better picture of how  an offense is truly  distrubiting the workload.?
Q - joe ?
Q - *** saturday update?
Q - qb troy aikman  (dal)?
Q - coach dave campo says he'll wait  until sunday to declare a  starter for this week's game.?
Q - hint to team,  maybe try throwing for less  than 500 yards?
Q - some say he's looking a  little more likely to start sunday.?
Q - others say the team is sandbagging and  he'll miss a couple of weeks.?
Q - even  if he does start, you'd have to think  thumb would be a problem.?
Q - *** saturday update?
Q - qb kurt warner  (stl)?
Q - st. louis post dispatch is  reporting warner will have the  pins removed from his finger tuesday.?
Q - remember early on that warner said  he'd return one day after the pins were  removed.?
Q - *** saturday update?
Q - rb obafemi  ayanbadejo (bal) will likely play although  sam gash will be the  starter.?
Q - *** saturday update rb tshimanga  biakabutuka's (car) outlook has dimmed?a  little as he was  downgraded to questionable.?
Q - he wasn't able to practice any  this week and  looks to be a gametime decision now.?
Q - if he can't go, brad  hoover will  start at tailback.?
Q - *** saturday update?
Q - rb tyrone  wheatley (oak) was unable to practice  saturday according to espn's john  clayton.?
Q - he could still play monday as  he's clearly shown he can play  through pain.?
Q - *** saturday update?
Q - rb trung canidate  (stl) is rumored to be making his  first appearance this week.?
Q - *** saturday update rb eddie george (ten)  went through the saturday walk  through today and looks to start.?
Q - *** saturday update?
Q - wr patrick  johnson (bal) gets another start with taylor  gone.?
Q - *** saturday update?
Q - wr terrell owens  (sf) took part in about 70% of  friday's practice.?
Q - coach steve  mariucci is reportedly leaning towards not  starting owens sunday although it  seems likely he'll play at least some.?
Q - the amount he could play will be  determined by how owens feels at gametime.?
Q - people always want  numbers so here's my  opinion:?
Q - chances he doesn't play at all:?
Q - 25% chances he plays but contributes less than his  normal numbers: 50% chances he plays and looks like the owens we've  been seeing: 25% weigh that out for what it's worth and make the  call that best suits your  team and situation.?
Q - ***saturday update?
Q - wr yancey thigpen  (ten) surprised us and put together 3  solid days of practice at the end  of the week.?
Q - coach fisher was even  talking about the titans taking some  shots downfield and thigpen figuring  into the gameplan.?
Q - *** saturday update?

Q - te tyrone davis  (gb) has a torn rotator cuff that will  require surgery in the  offseason.?
Q - *** saturday update te anthony becht's  (nyj) prospects are looking better  with fred baxter's injury.?
Q - *** saturday update?
Q - pk sebastian  janikowski (oak) is still not 100%.?
Q - he  tested his foot today and  according to espn's john clayton, the results were  less than encouraging.?

Q - ?????
Q - ????
Q - ?main estimates that its peak load  will reach 55,221 megawatts this  year, a 5.8% boost from last year's  actual peak load.
Q - ????
Q - ?while peak loads seem to be growing  at an extreme pace, demand levels  were actually much  lighter-than-expected last year, main's olson noted.

Q - ????
Q - ?the grid group estimates that if  any major transmission components are  lost in the region, import  capability from other regions will be slightly  tighter than last  year.
Q - ????
Q - ?main also said in its report that  heavy transmission flow from the  north to south last summer resulted  in numerous requests for "transmission  loading relief," or tlr's,  that are used to relieve pressure on overburdened  lines.

Q -   from http://opinionjournal.com  best of the web today - january 21, 2002 by james taranto left-wing rag or right-wing gag?
Q - on friday, acting on a tip from reader gregory brunt, we noted that the nation had published an article on its web site by  matt bivens  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001749#matt , the very first sentence of which contained a major factual error:  *** quote ***  when george w. bush co-owned the houston astros and construction began on a new stadium, kenneth lay agreed to spend $100 million over thirty years for rights to name the park after enron.
Q - apparently the magazine's editors agree; by saturday afternoon the bivens piece had disappeared from their web site (though the  modified version  http://www.thenation.com/cgi-bin/htsearch?config=&restrict=&exclude=&method=and&format=builtin-long&sort=score&words=houston+astros  still shows up in the nation's search engine).
Q - we all make mistakes, but this is only the latest in a string of staggeringly stupid stumbles by nation editors and writers that we've chronicled in recent months: - katrina vanden heuvel  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95000919#katrina , editor-in-chief of this political magazine, appeared on national television and could not name her own congressman.
Q - -columnist  eric alterman  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95000740#eric  apparently borrowed a phrase from george will in 1989--then, 12 years later, accused will of plagiarizing him.
Q - -just two weeks after sept. 11, columnist  katha pollitt  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001214#katha  wrote a piece in which she boasted of her contempt for the american flag.
Q - how could anyone be this dumb?
Q - well, remember david brock?
Q - is it possible that the nation, that venerable left-wing magazine, has been infiltrated by right-wing moles who are acting like idiots in an effort to discredit the left?
Q - noted thursday  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001739#krugman  a curious report in the new york times that times columnist paul krugman had once received $50,000 for serving on an enron "advisory board."
Q - does anyone serve on an advisory board for a for-profit company without compensation?
Q - yasser, that's the ticket--iii  http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/shart.jhtml?itemno=119598  secretary of state colin powell "made a renewed demand on sunday that palestinian authority chairman yasser arafat explain the arms shipment intercepted by the [israeli defense force] in the red sea on january 3," the israeli newspaper ha'aretz reports.
Q - what'll he do next, threaten to hold his breath until yasser fesses up?
Q - *** end quote ***  ok, guys, these are improving--but  our readers' explanations  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/jtaranto/?id=95001721  are still funnier.
Q - where's churchill when you need him?

Q - he tells the  telegraph  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/01/21/narch21.xml  that he didn't really mean that america is guilty of terrorism:  *** quote ***  the 51-year-old primate of wales agreed that terrorism was an evil that had to be rooted out, but said: "i don't think you root out terrorism by reproducing its methods.

Q - anthrax breakthrough?

Q - ?????
Q - ????
Q - ?main estimates that its peak load  will reach 55,221 megawatts this  year, a 5.8% boost from last year's  actual peak load.
Q - ????
Q - ?while peak loads seem to be growing  at an extreme pace, demand levels  were actually much  lighter-than-expected last year, main's olson noted.

Q - ?in 1999, by comparison, main's  actual peak demand load spiked to a  record 53,848 megawatts amid  extremely hot weather, olson said.
Q - ????
Q - ?the figures have been adjusted to  reflect madison, wis.-based alliant  energy corp.'s (lnt) move into  main last summer.

Q - ?main's summer report estimates that  61,353 megawatts of power will be  available in the region this  summer to meet the expected demand boost,  including contract  purchases of 1,886 megawatts.

Q - ?the strong power supply boost  should give the region an available  reserve margin of 18.4% this  summer, compared with forecasts for a 16.7%  reserve margin a year  ago.

Q - ????
Q - ?the grid group estimates that if  any major transmission components are  lost in the region, import  capability from other regions will be slightly  tighter than last  year.
Q - ????
Q - ?main also said in its report that  heavy transmission flow from the  north to south last summer resulted  in numerous requests for "transmission  loading relief," or tlr's,  that are used to relieve pressure on overburdened  lines.

Q - ????
Q - ?the grid group estimates that if  any major transmission components are  lost in the region, import  capability from other regions will be slightly  tighter than last  year.
Q - ????
Q - ?main also said in its report that  heavy transmission flow from the  north to south last summer resulted  in numerous requests for "transmission  loading relief," or tlr's,  that are used to relieve pressure on overburdened  lines.

Q - note the doorstep review would be an end to  end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review  of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the  review effort on areas of concern, the actions plans in place and concluding  on the 'mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level' prioritisation made for brm - which functions, not business units, require  external independent review - highly leveraging the above self assessment and  doorstep processes (could aa signoff simply by auditing our own internal  governance process?)
Q - - most likely reviews completed on functions that  assessed as concerns across multiple business - such as fx exposure  management, cash management, credit exposure management, it change management  controls/process  where are we now - if we all thought to do this immediately  we do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses - i  am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the houston  offsite do this?
Q - 23rd oct the above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as  senior controllers could put together for the audit committee - last week oct we agree on a robust tracking process - throw out one of the brm and doorstep  databases - november given aa have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate  the database from scratch - november review doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and  remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly - do we need to  visit all?
Q - wow - lets chat about this  mike  attachment 1     attachment 2 - the areas where a judgement should be proactively made by each  business unit controller -  business oversight system development project and change management people management - coaching and skills/headcount gaps model review stress testing and business risk identification operational capacity assessment signoff error management  control cycle risk management control recognition of risk origination monitoring of trading activities - limit checking, trader mandates specific transaction analysis - dash, cacs etc transaction capture - deal form analysis and risk management system input logistics support - delivery position analysis, incoming and outgoing invoice  maintenance, post deal execution contract management portfolio edits - required amendments to previously transacted risk/contracts market risk/position signoff - both transaction specific and portfolio  management dpr production and signoff limit excession reporting market risk feeds to grms - review var applicability (backtesting?)
