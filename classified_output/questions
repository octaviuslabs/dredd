Q - the wor= d  is that jim haslett  will likely not go outside the team for a back.?
Q - morton ,s a little undersized at 5 , 8 8  and 186 but so is sa= n  francisco's charlie garner and he manages pretty  well.?
Q - according to espn, brett favre ,s foot = is  much  better and he may practice this week.?
Q - with trung canidate out for the  year with a=   broken wrist, marshall faulk has reportedly told the coaches he may  be abl= e  to play this week.?
Q - coach norv turner has stated the starting qb job is=    brad?johnson's when he's?healthy, possibly in?week 13.  ?
Q - a= s  we head into our 12th week of listing these players, it ,s  inevitable th= at  some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade  list.?
Q - make sure=   you understand,  what we ,re talking about is players that are moving.?
Q - i= n  other words, a player like te chad  lewis could appear on the downgrade lis= t  and still be good enough to be a  starter in your league.?
Q - behind a beat=  up  line, he ,s standing in  there (while taking a beating) and delivering th= e  ball.?
Q - jimmy smith made a roaring comeback and  paired with keenan mccardel= l,  they ,re one of the better wr tandems in the  league.?
Q - he  looks more comfortable in  the pocket, especially in his footwork and drop=   backs.?
Q - watch to see how amani toomer is doing  but when he ,s healthy, t= oomer  and ike hilliard make a great wr corps.?
Q - a?solid ground game in ron dayne a= nd  tiki  barber continue to help the passing game.
Q - the bad  ne= ws  is he only completed 47% of his passes sunday.?
Q - the good news is he threw t= he  ball 55  times.?
Q - when a qb airs it out 55  times in one game, it doesn ,t=   usually bode well for the team ,s chances of  winning but it ,s certain= ly a  plus for your ff team to see that many  attempts.?
Q - remember, this list is  relative.?
Q - while he may no= t  be a  starter, dilfer is definitely moving up the charts and that ,s what=  this  list is  all about.?
Q - he actually looked very  good at times in the huge  victory over tennessee sunday.?
Q - brian billick did  wonders with a  marginally talented tony banks in 1999 and it ,s conceiva= ble  he might do it here  again with dilfer.?
Q - they play dallas  and cleveland ne= xt  but keep in mind baltimore has a bye on december  3.  qb troy  aikman (dal)?
Q - after being named the  starter sunda= y,  aikman went out and lit up the bengal defense which was ranked #  20 over t= he  last 4 weeks.?
Q - tough matchup this week  = vs  baltimore but he gets the vikings in week 13.  qb jeff  blake?
Q - you of course know by now that rb ricky williams is =   gone for 6-8 weeks.?
Q - i hate it for  williams owners (i ,m one) but what=  ,s done  is done.?
Q - all we can do now is look forward.?
Q - i make it a point to hold my tongue on  coaching  issues but i ,ve gotta say i think mr. charisma with the spiffy  sweaters= ,  wade phillips, is 100% wrong in going to johnson.?
Q - in terms of roster  management, he ,s  hands down the worst in the nfl in my opinion.?
Q - but no= ne of  that really matters as rob  johnson has to make the upgrade list since he=  ,s  been named the starter for this  week.?
Q - remember there was even  some talk about trading favre and starting=   hasselbeck this summer when favre ,s  elbow was a big concern.?
Q - before yo= u   give up the farm to snare hasselbeck, you should know brett favre is  reportedly  feeling better and hoping to play this week.?
Q - the injury will also likely add a little  fire under cade=   mcnown who may be rushed back a little sooner than he would have  been if=   miller was performing well.?
Q - matthews looked very rusty but it ,s tough = to  judge a qb when he ,s thrust  into the game like that.?
Q - although, if you ,ve got an owner salivating over s= mith  and you can get a  lot in return, it might be a great time to trade him.?
Q - his yard per carry number  d= ipped  to 2.6 in sunday ,s game and he faces the jets this week plus a brutal =   matchup against tampa bay in week 15.?
Q - yards per carry sunday  and=   the colts are leaning heavily on him.?
Q - smith quietly is having an incredible  year.?
Q - jaguar fans may be distraught, but fred  taylor owne= rs  have to be happy, at least lately.?
Q - taylor ,s running as well as he has i= n   his career, even if his team is struggling.?
Q - one can only wonder what he = ,d be  doing  with a healthy supporting cast.?
Q - but as everyone knows, taylor has a  gre= at  stretch run of opponents in weeks 14-16 when he faces cleveland, arizona  a= nd  cincinnati.?
Q - pittman ,s nursing a chest / rib injury  so ke= ep an  eye on that but assuming he ,s ok, he has to make the upgrade  list.?
Q - he likely won ,t be a factor long as marshall fau= lk is  already itching to  get back on the field but he might be worth a shot for=   one more  week.?
Q - ?=  new  orleans has a fairly favorable  rushing schedule ahead with oakland, denver= ,  san francisco and atlanta all  ahead.
Q - what else can you say but give the man   credit.?
Q - 8 catches for 164 yards  with a td is a pretty good day.?
Q - whether=   he and troy aikman can keep it rolling is the question but you  have to lik= e  what he ,s done thus far.?
Q - he ,s got a brutal matchup next week in bal= timore  but he might be worth  grabbing to play against the vikings in week 13.?
Q - excuse  us for not getting excited about a guy who=   was buried on the seahawks a few  weeks ago and had jon kitna throwing to=   him.?
Q - like  mcknight, the question is whether he can keep it up but he ,s worth=  a  roll of the  dice.?
Q - i drew a few snickers a month ago when i  said i  thought derrick mason was the best wr on the titans.?
Q - he  does face a couple of strong  defenses in washington and new orleans but i ,m  betting he manages to pr= oduce  against tough competition.?
Q - partly = by  default as kevin dyson ,s gone and carl pickens is injured.?
Q - and much to the  surprise of many, qb  steve mcnair fared pretty well and mason was a big pa= rt  of that  success.?
Q - great, just what fantasy gms need  )  another ram=  wr  to worry about.?
Q - in = an  offense missing rb marshall faulk  as high powered as the rams, there ,s=   probably room for another wr at the  trough.???
Q - johnson replaced travis taylor in the  lineup an= d  came up big with the game winning td.?
Q - still though, it ,s a brian  billick team and trent dilfer is pl= aying  better with each series it  seems.?
Q - with 10 catches for 117 yards, i guess you can s= ay  he ,s back.?
Q - the jags may be struggling but smith and  qb mark brunell ar= e  back in synch.?
Q - ride it while the combo is hot.?
Q - terrence wilkins had a firm grasp on the  #2 wr sp= ot  early in the season but pathon seems to be taking over there.?
Q - pathon is  playing with more confidence  and more importantly, seems to have the  confidence of qb peyton manning.?
Q - if he can just get that thumb  healthy (?
Q - after some quiet weeks, sharpe has  returned to=   his place of one of the premier tes in the game.?
Q - mike martz said a couple of weeks ago he  felt that=   having green behind center was  &just like having kurt in there 8.?
Q - the team is talking about december 3 as  a possible date he ,ll be back b= ut i , ve heard even sooner.?
Q - regardless, you have to figure his days  are  numbered.?
Q - plus, upcoming games  against washington and new orleans in the=   next two weeks could pose a  threat.?
Q - while everyone  was shouting about how many weeks he ,d miss, fav= re  told anyone who ,d listen  today that he looked to be ready for this week=  ,s  game against indianapolis.?
Q - players are notoriously optimistic so  keep an=   eye on it.?
Q - he really should have done  more against san=   francisco though.?
Q - on a side note, didn ,t he say he ,d shave that goo= fy beard  when they  lost?
Q - he ,s a gutsy kid and has  played throu= gh a  lot but it does seem to be affecting his  play.?
Q - miller had been=   moving the bears and  looked to be the spark chicago was missing with cade=   mcnown.?
Q - = nasty  injury  and too bad as he was showing promise.???
Q - garner ,s been a regular on the upgrade  list an= d he  had another huge game sunday where he posted 141 total yards with a  td  against the chiefs.?
Q - i  promise=   you he ,ll be shut out in week 13 (he has a bye.?
Q - i had to=   chuckle watching  saints head coach jim haslett talk about how ricky doesn=  ,t  play defense and  didn ,t make any of those sacks or force any fumbles an= d  about how ricky ,s just  one guy and they ,ll be fine.?
Q - ?that  sounds good jim but you ,re in for a rude awakening if  you really believ= e  that (i don ,t think he does)?
Q - 1.7 yards per carry will not get it done f= or  a  featured rb in this league and that ,s exactly what biakabutuka posted=    sunday.?
Q - it seems as if alstott is less of a factor every   game.?
Q - ?=   smith fumbled early on what should have  been a sure td and never seemed to=   recover.?
Q - so much for the idea of coach mike  holmgren  throwing in the towel for 2000 and starting the young players like   alexander.?
Q - the rookie is a fine  player and will get his time but for now,=   it doesn ,t , seem to be happening  anytime soon.?
Q - i have no idea how the rams  will function without  him.?
Q - is it just me or is marvin harrison  getting mor= e  and more quiet with each game??
Q - the loss of qb jim miller is huge.?
Q - robinson will make=   any qb better but there ,s only so much he can  do.?
Q - freeman appears to be headed toward the  path he=   was on a few weeks ago  ) mediocrity.?
Q - keyshawn johnson ,s gain is green ,s loss  as q= b shaun  king seems locked in on johnson.?
Q - suddenly, terrence wilkins is the  forgotten ma= n  in the colts passing game.?
Q - reimersma was a total non factor in  sunday ,s g= ame  catching only 1 pass for 7 yards.?
Q - one has to think the qb shuffle could =   have an effect.?

Q - mack brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.=   however, can he motivate?
Q - with guys the size that ut has, shouldn't even hodges=   mitchell be able to run?
Q - who tagged leonard davis as a pro?
Q - why does davis=   love mitchell?
Q - sure, he gained 1,300-plus yards last year, but how many of=   those yards were "move      the chains" type of runs that allowed ut to hold the ball on the ground=  and  protect a lead?

Q - how is the defensive end position shaping up?
Q - does  stockton take too long?
Q - can the line block?
Q - does brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls?
Q - why on earth would you ru= n  up the middle, on your own goal line against two of the best dts you'll pla= y  against?
Q - it probabl= y  isn't fair to question whether mack brown can motivate because his teams di= d  beat nebraska twice, oklahoma twice and texas a=02?once.

Q - q: is it true that in mack brown's four or five head coaching stops, hi= s  teams have yet to win a single conference championship?
Q - since ut has lost=   four out of its last five games, wouldn't a loss to houston this week  officially end mack brown's honeymoon with the alumni, notwithstanding his=   abundant pr program?
Q - he'll have to adjust now that it appears texas will be starti= ng  out the next few seasons in the top 10.   ?
Q - q: is lee jackson out for the houston game?
Q - q: what did mack brown say about the expectations surrounding his team = after  the loss to stanford?

Q - ?the company plans to bring a new  117-megawatt unit online in patoka,  ill., by mid- to late april,  spokesman ed mcdowall said.
Q - ?ameren is also re-powering its  grand tower facility, located in jackson  county in southern  illinois.
Q - ?ameren also has plans to boost  capacity at its 176-megawatt  pinckneyville, ill., plant located in  the southwestern part of the state.
Q - ?in its annual summer assessment,  main said that 5,473 megawatts of new  power has been added in the  region in the last year, or will be online  before the summer begins.
Q - ?the summer report was approved by  main's board of directors tuesday,  main spokeswoman jackie olson  said.
Q - ?in 1999, by comparison, main's  actual peak demand load spiked to a  record 53,848 megawatts amid  extremely hot weather, olson said.
Q - ?the figures have been adjusted to  reflect madison, wis.-based alliant  energy corp.'s (lnt) move into  main last summer.
Q - ?main's summer report estimates that  61,353 megawatts of power will be  available in the region this  summer to meet the expected demand boost,  including contract  purchases of 1,886 megawatts.
Q - ?according to main's summer report,  "main's import capabilities from its  surrounding regions are  considered adequate."
Q - ?a major illinois transmission  system added by exelon corp.'s (exc)  commonwealth edison co. last  summer as well as transmission upgrades from  other utilities have  improved transmission reliability in certain key areas  of the  region, main said.
Q - ?the grid group estimates that if  any major transmission components are  lost in the region, import  capability from other regions will be slightly  tighter than last  year.
Q - ?main also said in its report that  heavy transmission flow from the  north to south last summer resulted  in numerous requests for "transmission  loading relief," or tlr's,  that are used to relieve pressure on overburdened  lines.

Q - on friday, acting on a tip from reader gregory brunt, we noted that the nation had published an article on its web site by  matt bivens  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001749#matt , the very first sentence of which contained a major factual error:  *** quote ***  when george w. bush co-owned the houston astros and construction began on a new stadium, kenneth lay agreed to spend $100 million over thirty years for rights to name the park after enron.

Q - ?the company plans to bring a new  117-megawatt unit online in patoka,  ill., by mid- to late april,  spokesman ed mcdowall said.
Q - ?ameren is also re-powering its  grand tower facility, located in jackson  county in southern  illinois.
Q - ?ameren also has plans to boost  capacity at its 176-megawatt  pinckneyville, ill., plant located in  the southwestern part of the state.
Q - ?in its annual summer assessment,  main said that 5,473 megawatts of new  power has been added in the  region in the last year, or will be online  before the summer begins.
Q - ?the summer report was approved by  main's board of directors tuesday,  main spokeswoman jackie olson  said.
Q - ?in 1999, by comparison, main's  actual peak demand load spiked to a  record 53,848 megawatts amid  extremely hot weather, olson said.
Q - ?the figures have been adjusted to  reflect madison, wis.-based alliant  energy corp.'s (lnt) move into  main last summer.
Q - ?main's summer report estimates that  61,353 megawatts of power will be  available in the region this  summer to meet the expected demand boost,  including contract  purchases of 1,886 megawatts.
Q - ?according to main's summer report,  "main's import capabilities from its  surrounding regions are  considered adequate."
Q - ?a major illinois transmission  system added by exelon corp.'s (exc)  commonwealth edison co. last  summer as well as transmission upgrades from  other utilities have  improved transmission reliability in certain key areas  of the  region, main said.
Q - ?the grid group estimates that if  any major transmission components are  lost in the region, import  capability from other regions will be slightly  tighter than last  year.
Q - ?main also said in its report that  heavy transmission flow from the  north to south last summer resulted  in numerous requests for "transmission  loading relief," or tlr's,  that are used to relieve pressure on overburdened  lines.
Q - ?we post  our hourly indexes at about 9:30 a.m. cpt  each weekday; our daily and term  indexes are posted by 3:45 p.m.  cpt.

Q - ?in its annual summer assessment,  main said that 5,473 megawatts of new  power has been added in the  region in the last year, or will be online  before the summer begins.
Q - ?the summer report was approved by  main's board of directors tuesday,  main spokeswoman jackie olson  said.
Q - ?in 1999, by comparison, main's  actual peak demand load spiked to a  record 53,848 megawatts amid  extremely hot weather, olson said.
Q - ?the figures have been adjusted to  reflect madison, wis.-based alliant  energy corp.'s (lnt) move into  main last summer.
Q - ?main's summer report estimates that  61,353 megawatts of power will be  available in the region this  summer to meet the expected demand boost,  including contract  purchases of 1,886 megawatts.
Q - ?according to main's summer report,  "main's import capabilities from its  surrounding regions are  considered adequate."
Q - ?a major illinois transmission  system added by exelon corp.'s (exc)  commonwealth edison co. last  summer as well as transmission upgrades from  other utilities have  improved transmission reliability in certain key areas  of the  region, main said.
Q - ?the grid group estimates that if  any major transmission components are  lost in the region, import  capability from other regions will be slightly  tighter than last  year.
Q - ?main also said in its report that  heavy transmission flow from the  north to south last summer resulted  in numerous requests for "transmission  loading relief," or tlr's,  that are used to relieve pressure on overburdened  lines.
Q - ?the company plans to bring a new  117-megawatt unit online in patoka,  ill., by mid- to late april,  spokesman ed mcdowall said.
Q - ?ameren is also re-powering its  grand tower facility, located in jackson  county in southern  illinois.
Q - ?ameren also has plans to boost  capacity at its 176-megawatt  pinckneyville, ill., plant located in  the southwestern part of the state.
